- **Multi-Scale Integration**: Synthesize well-log, core, and seismic data through feature engineering and hierarchical classification
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Implement Bayesian inference methods to assess classification confidence and model reliability

#### 🔬 Methodological Framework

**Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
- Curated comprehensive well-log database (GR, SP, Resistivity, Density, Neutron, Sonic)
- Advanced signal processing: noise reduction, depth normalization, missing value imputation
- Feature engineering: statistical moments, spectral analysis, wavelet transforms

**Model Architecture**
